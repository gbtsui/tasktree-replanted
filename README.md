# TaskTree Replanted
## Abstract
TaskTree is a web app for managing projects by organizing tasks into a tree-like structure.
A continuation of my earlier project <a href="https://github.com/gbtsui/tasktree">TaskTree 
Version 1</a>. Made for <a href="https://highseas.hackclub.com">High Seas</a>, and also for
myself so I can actually manage big projects in my own life.

## Technologies Used
**Framework**: Next.js<br>
**Styling**: Tailwind<br>
**Database**: Supabase<br>
**ORM**: Prisma<br>
**Authentication Manager**: Auth.js

## Why does this exist?
I procrastinate a lot because big projects are really hard to start working on without clear planning.
It's a lot easier to start and work on projects when you can break it down into smaller, individual 
tasks that you have to do. It gets even easier when you also put those tasks in order. So TaskTree 
is basically like a to-do list, but cooler, because it's a tree. I'm an absolute sucker for organized,
clean, complex graphs and git trees. I also really like nature. So I combined the
concept of a chronological project manager with my love of forests and made TaskTree.
